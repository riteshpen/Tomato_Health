# Tomato_Health

## Information

Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in tomato plants. 
In this project, I am going to be creating a model to predict whether the
tomato is healthy, early-blight, or late-blight using image classification using CNN. 
Farmers can use this technology to predict whether their tomato plant has any diseases.
